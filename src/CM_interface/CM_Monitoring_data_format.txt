The sensor structures for the PL UART monitoring stream is as follows:
The CM uC will send four bytes via UART at 115200(or other).
Each byte will consist of two bits of byte type (MSbs) and six bits of data (LSBs).
The two bit sequence of 0b10 indicates a start of frame byte and a 0b00 indicates a data byte.
This leaves each transaction with 24 bits of data which will have 8 bits of sensor ID and 16 bits of data.
Ex:
