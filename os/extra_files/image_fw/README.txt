These files are for booting an APOLLO Service Module Zynq.
These files should be on the first partition of the sdcard and it should be a VFAT partition.

Filse:
  BOOT.BIN:              This is the FPGA firmware image loaded on boot
  image.ub:              This is the filesystem image that is mounted by petalinux.
  mac.dat:               This is the mac address info for eth0.  Eventually this will be set via the IPMC.
                         Go to http://ohm.bu.edu/trac/edf/wiki/Apollo%20Inventory#MACIPaddressassignment for an explanation of mac addresses
  README.txt:            This file.
  startup.sh:            A file run on boot
                         Copies daemon exes and other files to the /tmp directory for running
			 Starts XVC servers
			 Starts HTTP server
			 If un-commented, runs a dial home tunnel for web display.  (this is hard coded for now so check with Dan about port numbers)
			 Makes links to EMP C2C UIO devices for userpace IPBus access
  dropbear_rsa_host_key: This is the ssh key for this system.  It is not in the image and will be autogenerated if it doesn't exist.
                         Once generated, it should stay in /fw so the zynq has unique ssh keys.			
  http.id_rsa            These are local keys to log into the web publishing tunnels.
  http.known_hosts       These adds the remote tunnel's machine to the known hosts file for the http user
